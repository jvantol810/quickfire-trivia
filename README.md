# Quickfire Trivia: Fast-Paced Trivia Game using React

The site, currently hosted via Netflify, can be found [here](https://quickfire-trivia.netlify.app/).

## Project Description

Quickfire Trivia is a web app using React to handle updating UI components and the vanilla fetch to retrieve trivia categories and questions from [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/docs/). The game features a decrementing timer. You can increase the time by 5 seconds by answering a question right. Once the timer runs out, the game ends.
