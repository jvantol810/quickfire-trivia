# Quickfire Trivia: Fast-Paced Trivia Game using React

## Project Description

Quickfire Trivia is a web app using React to handle updating UI components and the vanilla fetch to retrieve trivia categories and questions from [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com/docs/). The game features a decrementing timer. You can increase the time by 5 seconds by answering a question right. Once the timer runs out, the game ends.

## Installing and Running the Project

Since this website is not currently hosted by me, you will have to compile and run the project locally. To do so, download the files from the GitHub page onto your local machine. Navigate to the directory 'trivia-app' in the terminal of your choice. Then, type ```npm install```. Once all the packages are installed, you can type ```npm start``` and the project should open in your default browser.
